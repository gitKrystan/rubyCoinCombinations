#Coin Counter

## Project

Input a monetary amount. Coin counter will tell you how to make change with the coins available in the bank.

By default, the bank has two of every coin but pennies and Sacagaweas. It has infinite pennies. The user inputs the amount of Sacagaweas the bank holds.

To view this code in action, go to our [Heroku app](https://coin-counter.herokuapp.com/).
